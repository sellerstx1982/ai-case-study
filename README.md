# Roaring Ahead With Aurora 
AI Case Study for Module 1 Challenge

## Overview and Origin
Aurora Innovation, Inc is a company focused on self-driving hardware and software. The company's headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Mountain View, California, with offices in San Francisco, Bozeman, Montana, and Texas. Aurora is currently testing vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), and Dallas (Texas), Detroit (Michigan), Louisville (Colorado), Seattle (Washington). [1] [2]

There isn't a specific story publicly released about how the three founders met or how they united to form the company in 2017, but all three have many years of experience in the self-driving field and it's believed they gravitated toward each other through that experience. [2] [3]

### Market Information

* Unable to specify actual total size of the market. [3]
* McKinsey & Company estimates the market size to be $1.5 trillion by 2030. [3]
* Aurora's market cap based on future potential is $4.4 billion. [3]

### Advantages

* Expertise of founders.
* Partnerships with vehicle manufacturers.
* Access to city streets and highways in Texas.

### Products

* Aurora Driver: Self-driving system installed and tested on Class 8 trucks and minivans in Texas since 2020 and 2022.
* Aurora Connect: Ride-sharing program using Toyota Sienna minivans set to begin in late 2024.

### Technologies

* LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): Uses FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) to build a three-dimensional map surrounding the vehicle, reaching up to 1,300 feet. [3]

* Cameras: High-resolution cameras recognize traffic signals, lane markings, and other visual indicators, allowing the Aurora Driver to drive safely. [3]

* Radar: Functions to support LiDAR and cameras during any weather condition and low-light instances. Radar easily detects objects at various distances. [3]

* Perception Software: Merges information from all sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radar) to process the vehicle's surroundings and create an up-to-date image encompassing the vehicle. This up-to-date image recognizes, objects, pedestrians, traffic signals, and more. [3]

* Localization and Mapping Software: Assists the Aurora Driver in exacting its spot on a map and travelling within that map. GPS, sensor data, and high-def maps help position the vehicle correctly within the correct area. [3]

* Decision-Making and Planning Software: Uses the perceived environment, mapping, and traffic regulations to make appropriate driving decisions. [3]

* Machine Learning: Algorithms are probably used to stack for tasks such as object recognition, sensor data processing, and optimized decision-making. [3]

* Powerful Computer System: The Aurora Driver has high-performing computers that are important for interpreting all the sensor data and handling complicated software algorithms while the system is functioning. [3]

* Integration Hardware: Devices that control operations that includes steering, braking, and acceleration. [3]

* Simulation Tools: Testing of the Aurora Driver using virtual environments to improve at a faster rate before entry to the real-world. [3]

## Industry Trends and Innovations

* Major Trends

    2014-2016: More investment and excitement had tech companies like Google and carmakers like Ford and General Motors accelerate researching autonomous driving. [3]

    2016-2020: Concern arose when deadlines for implementation were missed due to challenges of predictability in real-world situations. [3]

    2020-2024: Challenges were faced with caution and companies focused how to apply their products by partnering with automakers. [3]

* Other Trends

    Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) that automatically brake and warn drivers of cars nearby have become more common. [3]     

    Government regulations are continuing to be discussed in more detail to focus on issues like liability, safety and cybersecurity. [3]

    Ethical concerns such as whether to swerver or stay the course when danger arises begin to emerge. Other concerns are privacy, job          loss, biases are also being considered and addressed. [3]
