# Roaring Ahead With Aurora 
AI Case Study for Module 1 Challenge

## Overview and Origin
Aurora Innovation, Inc is a company focused on self-driving hardware and software. The company's headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Mountain View, California, with offices in San Francisco, Bozeman, Montana, and Texas. Aurora is currently testing vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), and Dallas (Texas), Detroit (Michigan), Louisville (Colorado), Seattle (Washington). [1] [2]

There isn't a specific story publicly released about how the three founders met or how they united to form the company in 2017, but all three have many years of experience in the self-driving field and it's believed they gravitated toward each other through that experience. 

## Founders

### Chris Urmson:
*Led Google's self-driving team as chief technology officer. [2]
### Sterling Anderson:
*Previously head of Tesla's Autopilot program. [2]
### Drew Bagnell:
*Formerly in charge of Uber's autonomy and perception team. [2] 

## Funding 

### Venture capital
* Sequoia Capital
* Greylock Partners
* Lightspeed Venture Partners
### Strategic partnerships
* Uber:
  Invested $400 million

### Going public
### Stock issuance

An estimate of the amount of funding for Aurora is $2.62 billion. This figure is based on their funding rounds of more than $1.8 billion from a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) in late 2021 and $820 million from a public and private stock offering in July 2023. [3]

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The problem Aurora is trying to solve is to make driverless cars safer and more reliable.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Aurora's intended customers are: traditional automakers, ride-sharing and delivery companies, and logistics companies.

Aurora's market size cannot be determined, but I found their market cap and market opportunity information about autonomous vehicles. Aurora's market cap, which is the total market value placed on Aurora based on its future potential is $4.4 billion. In regards to market opportunity information, McKinsey & Company predicts the autonomous vehicle market to be $1.5 trillion by 2030. [3]  

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Aurora has the expertise of the company's founders, who led the AI driving divisions at Google, Tesla, and Uber. In addition to the founders' background, Aurora already has a self-driving system, which is called the Aurora Driver. Aurora is provided actual vehicles from partnered companies including: Paccar, the manufacturers of Peterbilt and Kenworth, and Toyota. Aurora has tested both Class 8 (18 wheeler) trucks, along with Toyota's Sienna Minivan model. The Class 8 trucks having access to roads in Texas since 2020 has allowed Aurora to have to test and improve upon their product, the Aurora Driver. Toyota Sienna minivans have also been tested in the Dallas, Texas area. Aurora is expected to open Aurora Connect in late 2024 for ridesharing services in Dallas. These and many other factors, put Aurora in an elite class of autonomous driving companies in the industry. [3]

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): Uses FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) to build a three-dimensional map surrounding the vehicle, reaching up to 1,300 feet. [3]

Cameras: High-resolution cameras recognize traffic signals, lane markings, and other visual indicators, allowing the Aurora Driver to drive safely. [3]

Radar: Functions to support LiDAR and cameras during any weather condition and low-light instances. Radar easily detects objects at various distances. [3]

Perception Software: Merges information from all sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radar) to process the vehicle's surroundings and create an up-to-date image encompassing the vehicle. This up-to-date image recognizes, objects, pedestrians, traffic signals, and more. [3]

Localization and Mapping Software: Assists the Aurora Driver in exacting its spot on a map and travelling within that map. GPS, sensor data, and high-def maps help position the vehicle correctly within the correct area. [3]

Decision-Making and Planning Software: Uses the perceived environment, mapping, and traffic regulations to make appropriate driving decisions. [3]

Machine Learning: Algorithms are probably used to stack for tasks such as object recognition, sensor data processing, and optimized decision-making. [3]

Powerful Computer System: The Aurora Driver has high-performing computers that are important for interpreting all the sensor data and handling complicated software algorithms while the system is functioning. [3]

Integration Hardware: Devices that control operations that includes steering, braking, and acceleration. [3]

Simulation Tools: Testing of the Aurora Driver using virtual environments to improve at a faster rate before entry to the real-world. [3]

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Self-driving vehicles

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? 

The major trends in self-driving vehicles over the past ten years have included: 

2014-2016: More investment and excitement had tech companies like Google and carmakers like Ford and General Motors begin researching autonomous vehicles.

2016-2020: 

All the major technologies discussed above have improved over the past 10 years, including Cybersecurity to defend against hacking capabilities.



* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) 

Games for riders, and perhaps resulting in potential discounts for riders.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Games for fun, and for discounts gives the impression the company is fun, and  willing to give its customers an opportunity to save money if they choose.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Automated motorcycle riding technology would use aspects of the Aurora Driver to function. Automated flying technology might be influenced by the Aurora Driver too.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

There is a market for people who like riding motorcycles and would enjoy being able to let the autonomous technology take over sometimes, while enjoying the ride.
