* Logistics and Trucking Companies [3] [11]

### Market Information

* Autonomous vehicle market size in 2024 estimated to be $14.79 billion. [47]
* McKinsey & Company estimates autonomous-driving revenues could be between $300-$400 billion by 2035. [3] [12]
* Aurora's market cap based on future potential is $4.4 billion. [3] [13]

### Advantages

* Expertise of founders. [3] [14]
* Partnerships with vehicle manufacturers. [3] [15]
* Access to roads in Texas. [3] [16]

### Products

* Aurora Driver: Self-driving system used to safely operate cars or trucks. [3] [17] [18]
* Aurora Beacon: Base of operations that allows communcation on a variety of levels throughout trips. [3] [18] 
* Aurora Shield: Roadside assistance program that will be ready for any type of scenario. [3] [18]

### Technologies

* LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): Uses FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) to build a three-dimensional map surrounding the vehicle, reaching up to 1,300 feet. [3] [19]

* Cameras: High-resolution cameras recognize traffic signals, lane markings, and other visual indicators, allowing the Aurora Driver to drive safely. [3] [20]

* Radar: Functions to support LiDAR and cameras during any weather condition and low-light instances. Radar easily detects objects at various distances. [3] [20]

* Perception Software: Merges information from all sensors (LiDAR, cameras, radar) to process the vehicle's surroundings and create an up-to-date image encompassing the vehicle. This up-to-date image recognizes, objects, pedestrians, traffic signals, and more. [3] [21]

* Localization and Mapping Software: Assists the Aurora Driver in exacting its spot on a map and travelling within that map. GPS, sensor data, and high-def maps help position the vehicle correctly within the correct area. [3] [22]

* Decision-Making and Planning Software: Uses the perceived environment, mapping, and traffic regulations to make appropriate driving decisions. [3] [23]

* Machine Learning: Algorithms are probably used to stack for tasks such as object recognition, sensor data processing, and optimized decision-making. [3] [24]

* Powerful Computer System: The Aurora Driver has high-performing computers that are important for interpreting all the sensor data and handling complicated software algorithms while the system is functioning. [3] [17] [20]

* Integration Hardware: Nicknamed "Fusion", will control steering, braking, and acceleration. [3] [25]

* Simulation Tools: Testing of the Aurora Driver using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to improve at a faster rate before entry to the real-world. [3] [26]

## Industry Trends and Innovations

* Major Trends

    2014-2016: More investment and excitement had tech companies like Google and carmakers like Ford and General Motors accelerate researching autonomous driving. [3] [27]

    2016-2020: Concern arose when deadlines for implementation were missed due to challenges of predictability in real-world situations. [3] [28]

    2020-2024: Challenges were faced with caution and companies focused on how to apply their products by partnering with automakers. [3] [15] [16]

* Other Trends

    Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) that automatically brake and warn drivers of cars nearby have become more common. [3] [29]    

    Government regulations are continuing to be discussed in more detail to focus on issues like liability, safety and cybersecurity. [3] [30]

    Ethical concerns such as whether to swerver or stay the course when danger arises begin to emerge. Other concerns are privacy, job loss, biases are also being considered and addressed. [3] [31]
    
* Innovations

    LiDAR: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar has greater range, instant velocity data, and is interference free. [3] [32]

    Machine Learning: Taking the next step into deep learning models has improved recognition of road impediments, sensor processing, operation of the vehicle, among other things vital to automated driving. [3] [33] 

    Cybersecurity: Conducting reviews, installing vulnerability detections and prevention software, and improving the ability to surveil and react to threats.  [3] [34]

## Results

* Business Impact

     Transforming the trucking industry to reduce the number of drivers necessary. [3] [35]

     Investor interest and going public has fueled much of Aurora's financial growth. [3] [36] 

     Partnerships with vehicle manufacturers has shown confidence in generating revenue down the road. [3] [6]

* Core Metrics

     Technical Milestones: Successful road testing of the Aurora Driver. [3] [37]

     Partnerships: Maintaining platform, logistics, and technology partners. [3] [38] [39] [40] 

     Investors: Venture capital, going public, and stock issuance has shown confidence in Aurora's future. [3] [5] [6] [7] [8]

  * Major Competitors

    Waymo: Google's parent company Alphabet's self-driving car that current offers ride-sharing service in Phoenix, Arizona. [3] [41]

    Cruise: General Motors' subsidiary that has tested vehicles in several U.S. cities. [3] [42] 

    Tesla: Autopilot system assists, but is not fully autonomous. Tesla expects their vehicles to be fully self-driving at some point. [3] [43]

## Recommendations

### Potential Services
  
* Delivering food and other items to consumers.
* Games for riders to promote discounts when automated ride services begin for commercial use. [44]
* Self-driving motorcyles will be a safer way for riders to navigate cities and enjoy scenery in rural areas.

### Additional Technologies for Potential Services

* Robotics to bring consumer items from vehicle to phyisical location to ensure customer satisfaction. [45]
* Touch screens in vehicles to select and play games to give consumers a way to save money.
* More advanced version of Aurora Driver to perform the actions of riding a motorcycle.

> "Building on years of development and testing, our work toward the safe and scalable deployment of driverless trucks is nearing a historic milestone. Today will show why we believe we will have the essential components not only for Commercial Launch but also deployment at scale to support a strong and self-sustaining business," said Chris Urmson, CEO and co-founder of Aurora.
